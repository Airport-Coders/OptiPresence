## Key Problems solved 🚀

-   **Eliminating "Buddy Punching"** 🚫👊: This is a common problem in workplace and academic environments where one person signs in for another, leading to inaccurate work records. The blockchain system of the project has integrated with facial biometric authentication and location, ensuring that only the authorized employee or student can record their own attendance.

-   **Precise Time Monitoring** ⏰: Whether it's keeping track of employee work hours or monitoring student attendance and participation in academic activities, discrepancies can often arise, leading to conflicts. However, with the implementation of the project, accurate and irrefutable records are established, guaranteeing fairness and transparency.

-   **Simplified Auditing** 📊: Using blockchain simplifies the conduct of internal and external audits. This applies to compliance with labor regulations in the workplace and compliance with academic standards and regulations of educational institutions. The immutability of blockchain records reduces the need for extensive manual verification.

-   **Adapt to different systems** 🔧: The flexibility of the project allows check-in rules to be adapted to different scenarios, including different employment contracts and academic obligations. This flexibility supports a variety of work arrangements and educational plans and accommodates different rules and regulations.

-   **Integration with other systems** 🔄: For workplaces, the solution can integrate with existing HR(payroll) systems to streamline payment processes based on validated data. In education, it can connect to student information systems to update academic records, attendance scores and other relevant data. This reduces errors and administrative burden while ensuring records are up to date and accurate.

-   **Extended to other verification requirements** ✅: In addition to check-in, the solution can be customized for a variety of other verification requirements. This includes obtaining and verifying academic transcripts, professional certifications, event or seminar attendance, and even medical records or treatment plans. The secure, transparent, and immutable nature of the project provides a solid foundation for any system that requires an indisputable record.
