Here you can find the structure of the project, including the smart contracts, frontend, offchain, docker services, and CI/CD workflow. 🏗️

## High Level Overview of user interaction 🌐

A user interaction diagram that shows the flow of the user interaction with the system. The user can register, create an event, check-in to an event, and validate the check-in.

## Contracts 📄

You can find the smart contracts in the [contracts folder](https://github.com/Airport-Coders/OptiPresence/tree/main/smartcontracts/packages/hardhat/contracts) and the tests in the [test folder](https://github.com/Airport-Coders/OptiPresence/tree/main/smartcontracts/packages/hardhat/test) of the repository. The contracts are written in Solidity and are used to manage the user registry, event management, and check-in processes. The tests are written in TypeScript and are used to ensure the contracts are functioning as expected with different scenarios.

### UserRegistry 📚

Manages user registrations and their facial identifiers, ensuring added security through encapsulation. Users are identified by addresses, and their data includes names and IPFS hashes of facial images. The contract employs modifiers to validate user existence, name, and face hash integrity. Features functions for registering, updating, and retrieving user information, with events logged for new registrations and updates.

### EventManager 🎉

Manages event creation and details, tailored for use with a decentralized platform. It defines an `Event` struct to store comprehensive event details, including name, description, image hash (stored as an IPFS hash), location (latitude and longitude), owner, start and end times, and an activity status. The contract supports creating new events, updating existing events, and retrieving event information, ensuring actions such as updates are restricted to the event's owner. Modifiers validate event data, including time ranges, locations, and IPFS image hashes. Events for creation are emitted to log activity.

### CheckInManager 📌

Manages check-in requests and validations for events, integrating with external `EventManager` and `UserRegistry` contracts. It supports functionalities including request submission, off-chain validation, and check-in status management. Structs and enums define check-in data and status. Features include limiting check-in attempts, validating event existence and timing, and ensuring actions are performed by designated roles such as the off-chain validator. The contract emits events for different stages of the check-in process, enabling transparency and traceability. It allows users to retrieve their check-in statuses and provides functionalities for the off-chain validator to approve or reject check-ins based on external validations.

### Internal Interaction Sequence 🔀

This diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions between the contracts, including the `UserRegistry`, `EventManager`, and `CheckInManager`. It shows the flow of actions such as check-in request submission and off-chain validation. The sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of the interactions and the order of operations between the contracts. You can see the `CheckInManager` is the central contract that interacts with the other two contracts, and the sequence of actions for check-in requests and validations.
